**callnasty/callnasty** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm AndrÃ© and I like music, dancing and reading.

For not such a long time I experiment with music programming languages and such. That's why I'm here and thankful for all the innovation going on here in that area.
ðŸŒŒSuperColliderðŸŒŒ is my language of choice. I also like ðŸš²TidalCyclesðŸš², which is based on it, but in å…¥Haskellå…¥. Also I'm trying to learn â˜¾Luaâ˜½ so I can use a Monome norns for future experimentations and eventual live performances.
