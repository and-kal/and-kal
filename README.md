### Heyyyy everyone! (Â¬_Â¬)ï¾‰

I'm AndrÃ© and I like music, dancing and reading.

For not such a long time I experiment with music programming languages and such. That's mostly why I'm here.
ðŸŒŒSuperColliderðŸŒŒ is my language of choice. I also like å…¥ðŸš²TidalCyclesðŸš²å…¥, which is based on it.
I love people for their inoovations in these tools.

Moreover, I'm in a Web Dev traibning course right now, which is why I might need to clutter this profile here with mostly tedious and boring exercise and example files.
